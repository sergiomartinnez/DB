## General info

On this course I learned the concepts of relational and non-relational databases how to create a ER tree of problems for better visualization, and how to normalize them using the 4FN. In the repository you will find a simple SQL document for all the queries used in the course for example, insert, acces, modify, delete the data, and how to query the information for specific questions that you have.In this project  i use a Non-Relational databse Firestore by google for using one databased based on documents and collections.

>- MySQL Workbench
>- Firebase
